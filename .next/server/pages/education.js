Pairing xUSD with other Assets in liquidity will allow xUSD to benefit from that Asset going up or down in price. When BNB goes up 0.5% or down 1% xUSD will be traded against it to keep the price reflective of its real world value. Day Traders / Arbitrage Traders will be able to profit off of this structure. The token will have the traditional XSurge price gain algorithm employed but will serve its extended purpose as an intermediary token between all existing Surge Variant tokens. Staking Liquidity for XUSD will be highly incentivized via reduced taxation + Passive XUSD Dividends. The more XUSD staked in different trading pools, the more Arbitrage (TX Volume) it will gain. We are starting with the XUSD - BNB Pool, but will be adding new trading pools over time and allow their Liquidity Providers to receive passive income"
