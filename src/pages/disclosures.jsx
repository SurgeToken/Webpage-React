							The Surge Protocol prevents a Surge Token's price from ever going down when compared to it's backing asset. Surge Tokens may be redeemed for their Backing Assets, and the redeemable value of 1 Surge Token will always rise. The fiat value of a Surge Token relies entirely on the fiat value of its backing asset.  Both of these factors should be taken into consideration before investing.  Please see our risks disclore below before investing.
